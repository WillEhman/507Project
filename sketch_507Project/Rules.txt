The goal is to find a partition that satisfies or beats the Net Cut number shown at the top of the screen, in the middle.
To begin, select a difficulty level and then press start to begin the game.

You are competing against the computer to find the best partition. The computer will always find a solution that meets the 
desired net cut number, so you are racing to find the best solution first.

The left side of the screen is the player side, where you will be partitioning the given net.
Click anywhere to begin drawing your partition. Clicking again will draw a line from the last point of the partition line
to the mouse cursor. Double clicking will automatically send the line to the bottom of the screen, completing your partition.

If your partition does not meet the balance criteria at the bottom of the scren, in the middle, you will have the opportunity to
try again. If the partition meets the balance criteria, then the game is over and the program will compare your solution to the
desired net cuts and decide a winner.

Good Luck!
